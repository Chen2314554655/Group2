Requirement Specifications

    we hope to make a small game based on the win system. 
    
    The system randomly selects rock, paper-scissors, and compares it with the rock-paper-scissors selected by the user

Dream processs()

    We want the system to have randomness instead of making a fixed choice 

Laws/rules/standards ()
 
    After the system is randomly generated, 
    it will be retained and compared with the user's choice,and the user will be prompted under different results, 
    the same is a tie, the user will be prompted for victory or failure, 
    and will be refreshed in the next round
