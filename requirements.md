Laws/rules/standards ()

    In a 4*4 grid, two numbers are randomly generated at the beginning,
    and then one number is generated each time,the number generated can only be 2

    We can use up, down, left and right to move the numbers globally, 
    The same number can be added after moving
    Different numbers cannot be added 
    until one number reaches 2048. 

    When all the grids have numbers, 
    and there are no identical numbers adjacent to each other so that you cannot moveã€‚  
    the game is over
