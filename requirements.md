We hope to make a small game based on the win system, the name is 2048

In a 4*4 grid, two numbers are randomly generated at the beginning,
and then one number is generated each time, and each number is 2. 

We can use up, down, left and right to move the numbers globally, 

The same number can be added after moving
Different numbers cannot be added 
until one number reaches 2048. 

When all the grids have numbers, 
and there are no identical numbers adjacent to each other so that you cannot moveã€‚  
the game is over
