Game program specification
（1）We want to use the web as a carrier to make a simple rock-paper-scissors game, so that everyone can relax and entertain after work and study.                                         
（2）Interactive system
Use an interactive system to provide simple teaching. The system tells the user the meaning of each number to help users start the game faster (for example, rock represents 1,scissors represents 2, and cloth represents 3)
After completing an operation, the system informs the user whether he wins or loses.
And give the option whether to do it again or exit directly.
The interface should be clear and fun, and does not require a network connection.
After the user completes the operation, the system should inform the user of the choice and the choice given by the system.
